## Introduction to cloud computing

### 3 cloud service models
1. Iaas (infrastructure as a service)
2. Paas (platform as a service)
3. Saas (software as a service)

* more control over IT resources from 1 to 3.

### 3 cloud computing deployment models
1. Cloud -- all on cloud
2. Hybrid -- cloud and existing on premises
3. On-premises (private cloud)

### Difference between old and cloud
![Alt text](image-2.png)
There are many similarities between AWS and the traditional, on-premises IT space:
* AWS security groups, network access control lists (network ACLs), and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) are similar to firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), and administrators.
* Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) are similar to routers, 
network pipelines, and switches.
* Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances are similar to on-premises servers.
* Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS), Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) are similar to direct attached storage (DAS), storage area networks (SAN),network attached storage (NAS), and a relational database management service (RDBMS).


## Advantage of the cloud
1. Trade capital expense for variable expense
* save money and time
-- you can pay only when you consume resources and pay only for the amount that you consume. Thus, you save money on technology.
-- use space as much as you need in minutes instead of weeks or days.Thus, maintenance is reduced.

2. Massive economies of scale
* save money because of wholesale
-- Because of aggregate usage from all customers, AWS can achieve higher economies of scale and pass savings on to customers.

3. Stop guessing capacity
* scaling on demand

4. Increase speed and agility

6. Go global in minutes
* -- deploy your application in multiple AWS regions around the world.Thus, you can provide lower latency and a better experience for customer.


## Introduction to AWS(Amazon web services)

### What are web services?
* A web service is any piece of software that makes itself available over the internet and uses a standardized format--such as Extensible Markup language(XML) or JavaScript Object Notation(JSON)--for the request and the response of an application programming interface(API) interaction.
